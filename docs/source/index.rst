===================================
Welcome to PySSC's documentation!
===================================

| **PySSC** is a Python implementation of the fast Sij approach to Super-Sample Covariance (SSC).
| It allows to easily compute the SSC part of the covariance for most cosmological observables.
| You can find the code at `<https://github.com/fabienlacasa/PySSC>`_
| The original full-sky implementation was developed by `Lacasa & Grain 2018 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...624A..61L/exportcitation>`_ (`arXiv:1809.05437 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05437>`_).
| The partial sky implementation was developed by `Gouyou Beauchamps et al. <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210902308G/exportcitation>`_ (`arXiv:2109.02308 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02308>`_).
| See the :doc:`bibliography` section to find additional dependencies to cite if you use the code.
